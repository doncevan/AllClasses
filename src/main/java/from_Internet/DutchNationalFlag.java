/* Dutch National Flag Problem (Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s):
Given an array A [] consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s. The task is to write a function that sorts the given array.

Algorithm:

Initialize three pointers: low, mid, and high.
Traverse the array:
If the current element is 0, swap it with the element at the low pointer and increment both low and mid.
If the current element is 1, just increment mid.
If the current element is 2, swap it with the element at the high pointer and decrement high.
3. Continue until mid-crosses high. */
