/* Merge Two Sorted Arrays:
Algorithm:

Initialize an empty array to store the merged result.
Initialize pointers i, j, and k to 0 to track the positions in the two input arrays and the merged array, respectively.
Compare elements from both arrays and add the smaller one to the merged array.
Increment the pointer of the array from which the element was added and the pointer for the merged array.
Repeat until both input arrays are completely traversed.
Copy any remaining elements from either array to the merged array.
Return the merged array. */
